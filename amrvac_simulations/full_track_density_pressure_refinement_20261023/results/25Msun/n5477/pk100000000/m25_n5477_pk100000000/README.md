# m25_n5477_pk100000000: complete 25-Msun history

Survey-grid history; publication does not approve a surrogate or physical-width claim.

Exact Float64 DAT endpoint 7 Myr, 71 full saves from age zero at 0.1-Myr cadence plus endpoint. Wind: MS to 6.5 Myr (2e-7 Msun/yr, 1500 km/s), RSG to 7 Myr (1e-5 Msun/yr, 15 km/s); no WR; no SN. n_ref = 5477 cm^-3 at 1 pc; external P/k_B = 100000000 K cm^-3. Effective external confinement may represent surrounding cloud weight; fixed initial star+cloud gravity is already modeled and must not be double-counted. Neutral support/relaxation retained; no evolving self-gravity/photoionization/tabulated cooling/conduction.

Original static/smoke/full guards exited 0 with one finish and empty stderr; 190 original source/binary/runtime/input pins passed. The new selected pull matches every remote/local SHA256 and byte count with empty checksum dry-runs. `raw/` preserves all completed case files, including static/smoke saves, full DAT/VTU pairs, logs, original validation and COMPLETE marker. Other active outputs/queue logs were excluded. Shared dataset provenance: `provenance/Keohane2_midpoint25_pair_20261030T185000Z/`.

`native_profiles/` contains 71 CSVs of 1024 native conservative cells. The VTU representation has 1152 interpolated vertices. Float64 DAT controls age/cadence; Float32 VTU labels retain rounding. Units cm, g, s; 365-day year; AMRVAC Msun = 1.98892e33 g. Cumulative gas excludes the star and r < 0.001 pc. Positive density-excess mass is Eulerian, not tracer-defined swept mass; signed gas change is retained. Independent mass reintegration passed. `images/` has every density PNG; preferred full/inner phase/mass/flow and all-save sheet are in `reviewed_diagnostics/`. All 80 PNGs were integrity-checked; visual QA is described in shared scientific_review_qa.json. Mass axes: cm bottom/pc top, g left/Msun right.

Native/frozen-runtime positivity, analytic initial atmosphere, exact endpoint/cadence and phase-rate/speed gates passed. Endpoint outer 40--160 pc density drift = 0.022052774%, pressure drift = 0.0038028847% (<2%); the full transient history is retained. local_jump_v1 is an operational search beyond 1.2 times the separately flow-selected termination candidate when present. Missing separate rise/outer peaks do not prove absence of swept gas; legacy peak-envelope diagnostics remain separately defined. Exact endpoint candidate records below are numerical diagnostics, not physical shock thickness, converged GRB-wall evidence or an approved fit surrogate.

Prescribed injection rates/speeds pass TRACK gates. Shared scientific_review_qa.json retains first-cell evolved flux/speed estimates, which are not boundary Riemann flux measurements; single-mesh flux convergence remains unestablished. Keep all 12 holdouts withheld. No surrogate training/MCMC/silent extrapolation or universal-law fit.
